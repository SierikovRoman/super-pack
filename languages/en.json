			"desc" : "Wrapping machine intended for packing goods by the \"envelope\" method (cellophanization). Cellophane is a convenient and perfect way of packing products in polypropylene film. The film with this method of packaging, while maintaining its transparency, beautifully tightens the products to be packed without the use of heat shrinkage. Cellophanes are usually used for packaging tea and coffee packs, cookie packages, electronic and classical cigarettes, cosmetics and perfumes, audio and video cassettes, DVDs and CDs, playing cards and other products. \r\n\r\nBy degree of automation cellophanes can be automatic, semi-automatic and manual. Accordingly, the wrapping machine automatically performs all operations in an automatic mode, while achieving high performance. On manual wrapping machine, all stages of packaging formation are performed due to manual labor of the operator. \r\n\r\n Portable, lightweight, compact cellophane is popular with enterprises that produce products in small batches. If it is important for you that your goods look the best, they are protected and at the same time attract buyers, then a hand-wrapping machine is just what you need. Cellophane is simple and reliable in operation. The absence of moving elements contributes to a long service life of the equipment."

			"desc" : "Wrapping Machines are divided into two types:\r\n\r\nwith a mechanical control unit (krutilochki) digital\r\n\r\nDiffer from each other accuracy of adjustment. The mechanical temperature is regulated not by the temperature, but by the% of the power supplied to the heating plate. Because of this it is less convenient, it takes a lot of time to adjust the temperature after each switch-on (this is the loss of time and the consumption of the film). However, if you have several packages per day, you can be content with it. This is the cheapest option on the Ukrainian market (and possibly in the whole CIS). \r\n\r\nThe second - with the electric unit (pictured) - allows you to change the temperature to within 1 degree and allows you to monitor the current temperature. Also it is equipped with better heaters, which better keep the temperature. This allows you to have less power consumption than mechanical, more beneficial for long-term operation."
